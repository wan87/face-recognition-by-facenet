* __Installing dependencies:__
  * For Anaconda users: `conda install --file requirements.txt`<br>
  * For python users: `pip install -r requirements.txt`<br>
    (even Anaconda users can use this if they use anaconda prompt instead of terminal)

* __Downloading the model__:<br>
  The repository requires an additional file to work. The file is too large to upload here.
  So I've provided a Google Drive link of it. Download the file and keep it inside `/data/model/` directory.<br> [Click Here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1PZ_6Zsy1Vb0s0JmjEmVd8FS99zoMCiN1)  to download the file.
